## Gist

* Welcome to ECE 4/599! I'm really excited to dive deep into some research with you all this quarter!

* What is a compiler, and why should we care?
    * A simplistic answer is all about making programs go fast. And optimization is important, but compare Moore's law to Proebsting's law.
    * This class is about *language implementation* more broadly. What else goes into a good language implementation other than optimizations? (Not parsing.) Post your ideas in the [discussion topic][topic].
        * By the way, [lessons][] in 6120 have an associated discussion thread. We'll use these for just generally talking about stuff and also for reporting our results.
    * New languages + new hardware = lots of interesting problems.
        * Either one alone would be plenty to keep compiler engineers busy for a long time.
* Course overview and the [syllabus][].
    * Communication will be on [Zulip][]. [Sign up][zulip-signup] and stay on top of it!
    * Class sessions:
        * "Lesson" days.
            * I'll do some traditional "lecturing" in class, but that stuff is (mostly) mirrored by the videos attached to each lesson.
            * Most (but not all) lessons have associated tasks for you to complete.
        * "Discussion" days.
            * Everyone's job is to read the paper ahead of time and post a thoughtful comment.
            * The discussion leader's job is to write a blog post.
            * Remember to keep track of the [schedule][] so you know when to do these things!
        * Hacking sessions. 
    * The course project.
    * "Michelin star" grading.
    * Policies, academic integrity, generative AI, respect, accessibility.
* This lesson's task is about debugging the course structure.
    * Ask questions about the course setup in this lesson's [discussion topic][topic]!
    * Your first task is below: introduce yourself in the [introductions topic][intro] right now, and (offline) pick a paper discussion to lead.
        * This website and the [blog][], including the [GitHub repository][gh] where you'll send PRs. Work for 6120 is "real," open source, and for the world.
    * When you've done those things, submit the L1 marker assignment on [CMS][].

## Tasks

* Read the [syllabus][]! 
* Do the reading for Wednesday
* Sign up for Discord and introduce yourself
* Form teams within your group
* Pick a paper from the [schedule][] whose discussion you want to lead.
  Claim it by opening a pull request that modifies [`content.toml`][cont-gh] to fill in your name on one of the `leader = "TK"` lines.
