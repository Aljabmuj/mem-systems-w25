I'm excited to teach this new research course on memory systems at OSU! We'll be covering a lot of ground,
focusing on systems software research, but touching areas in memory technologies, fault tolerance, distributed systems, storage, hardware accelerators, and much more. 

We'll use this course blog for paper discussions and project reports throughout the quarter.
