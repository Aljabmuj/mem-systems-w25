# Extra Reading

## Miscellaneous Research Advice
Here are some extra readings containing priceless advice on conducting systems research (and research more broadly)
from people that are much smarter than me:
- John Ousterhout: [Always Measure One Level Deeper](https://cacm.acm.org/research/always-measure-one-level-deeper/)
- Torsten Hoefler and Roberto Belli's excellent [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2807591.2807644) on applying sound benchmarking, data reporting techniques, and statistical methods in systems work. 
- David Patterson on the [importance of benchmarks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2209249.2209271)
- Richard Hamming's [guide on doing research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html). I was once given the advice to "keep this on your desk and read it every year." My thoughts on it have changed over the years. 
- Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau on [a proven problem-finding method](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/keynote)
- Lamport on [how to present a paper](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/howto.txt)
- John Regehr on [picking research problems](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/46)
- Saurabh Bagchi on [doing systems research](https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/computer-systems-research-the-joys-the-perils-and-how-to-count-beans-well/)
- Remzi again on [finding research problems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3568161.3568316)
- Lamport on [writing proofs](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-how-to-write.pdf). We don't use proofs _often_ in systems work (much to Lamport's chagrin), but there are certainly cases where it is necessary. 

As you may have surmised from the above list, it turns out one of the most challenging problems in doing research, is finding the right problem to work on.
